            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <div id="isPasted" class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
                <div class="wpb_wrapper">
                    <p><strong>Online learning</strong>&nbsp;has been on the rise in recent years, and it&rsquo;s really
                        not hard to see why. On the one hand, eLearning courses have become hugely popular by the simple
                        virtue of being so much more convenient than traditional face to face courses.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
                <div class="wpb_wrapper">
                    <p>Students can fit them around their existing responsibilities and commitments, and can engage with
                        multimedia content and learning materials at whatever time is most convenient to them. Even
                        better: they don&rsquo;t have to travel anywhere to study, they can simply log in to the virtual
                        campus from the comfort of their own home or office.</p>
                    <p>There&rsquo;s a second reason why online learning has become so popular: it&rsquo;s cheaper. Cost
                        can often be a prohibitive factor in why individual students don&rsquo;t enroll in courses
                        they&rsquo;re interested in. This is also an issue for corporations who wish to encourage their
                        employees to undergo further training but don&rsquo;t have much of a budget for conferences and
                        training courses.&nbsp;<strong>Online courses</strong>&nbsp;are easily accessible on much
                        smaller budgets.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the convenience and the cost, a large number of students are turning to online
                        learning courses because they have become a better way to learn. Those students who are serious
                        about improving their understanding, learning new skills and gaining valuable qualifications are
                        keen to enroll in the type of course that will be the most effective.</p>
                    <p>Here are five reasons why&nbsp;<strong>online learning</strong>&nbsp;can be more effective than
                        enrolling in a face to face training course.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>#1. Students learn more than they do in traditional courses.</strong></p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>IBM have found that participants learn five times more material in online learning courses using
                        multimedia content than in traditional face to face courses. Because online courses give
                        students full control over their own learning,</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;students are able to work at their own speed. Generally students work faster than they
                        would do otherwise and take in more information. They are able to move faster through areas of
                        the course they feel comfortable with, but slower through those that they need a little more
                        time on.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>#2. Retention rates are higher with online learning</strong></p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Many offline courses struggle to retain students throughout the length of the course. The
                        Research Institute of America have found that this is not the case with eLearning. Rather,
                        online courses have increased student retention rates from anything from 25% to 60%.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s been suggested that more engaging multimedia content, more control over how they
                        take in the material and less likelihood of classes clashing with other commitments all
                        contribute to this rise.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>#3. Online learning requires less of a time investment</strong></p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Many students are put off enrolling in a face to face course due to the time investment it will
                        require. This generally involves the time to get back and forth to classes, plus the time spent
                        waiting for tutors and other students. A Brandon Hall report on eLearning within corporations
                        found that this style of learning typically requires 40-60% less employee time than learning in
                        a traditional classroom setting.</p>
                    <p>It&rsquo;s also key to note that eLearning options generally allow students to split the time
                        they are investing in the course in whichever way works for them. They don&rsquo;t need to be
                        able to dedicate large chunks of time to the course: it&rsquo;ll work just as well if they can
                        set aside half an hour from their lunch break or after school each day.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>#4. More frequent assessments can reduce distractions</strong></p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>One of the great things about online courses is that assessment can become more of an ongoing
                        process. This is good news for students as interspersing multimedia content and learning
                        materials with regular short tests can improve student engagement. In fact, research from
                        Harvard showed that using these short, regular tests halved student distraction, tripled
                        note-taking and students&rsquo; overall retention of the content improved.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s also worth noting that the more often students are assessed, the better their
                        tutors are able to keep track of their progress. Increased student tracking means that tutors
                        are able to step in earlier when assistance is needed.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>#5. eLearning is the greener option</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                    <p>Online learning is certainly the more effective option for students, but it&rsquo;s also better
                        for the environment.The Open University in Britain have found that online courses equate to an
                        average of 90% less energy and 85% fewer CO2 emissions per student than traditional in person
                        courses.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>This certainly makes online learning and multimedia content a more effective method of education
                        overall. Promoting and engaging in this kind of learning can help both individuals and
                        corporations to do their bit for the environment and stick to their own personal environmental
                        goals.</p>
